        <h2>Finding our team name</h2>
        <p>Let's give more attention to the dynamics of the mentor-student relationship between a padawan and sense√Ø, while relating to our shared interest in full stack development. Here are proposals that highlight our connection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The FullStack Journey</strong>: a name that embodies our journey in the world of full stack development, emphasizing the process of learning and teaching.</li>
            <li><strong>The Dev Shoguns</strong>: inspired by the term "shogun", highlighting leadership and guidance in development learning.</li>
            <li><strong>The Coding Kai</strong>: inspired by the term "kai", meaning gathering or meeting in Japanese, which invokes the idea of joint learning between mentor and student.<br>
            <mark>my favorite one</mark></li>
            <li><strong>MentorMatrix Devs</strong>: integrates the concept of a structured learning environment (matrix) with developmental mentoring.</li>
            <li><strong>CodeCraft Apprentices</strong>: evokes the idea of craft in coding, with the sensei serving as the master craftsman and the padawan serving as the apprentice.</li>
            <li><strong>ZenStrong Circle</strong>: the combination of Zen tranquility and wisdom with coding is ideal for a group that values growth and learning.</li>
            <li><strong>CodeWisdom Pathfinders</strong>: conveys the notion of navigating the world of development with the guidance of the sensei's wisdom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have chosen a selection of names that aim to celebrate and honor the bond between a padawan and his sensei, while reaffirming our passion for full stack development. My hope is that these suggestions will inspire you and aid us finding the perfect name for our team!</p>
